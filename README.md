# Suave-Synthesizer
My personal project that I use for my own music production. Its constantly updating and getting better hopefully for a proper release.

## Notes
Version 3: Can make a simple synth that outputs different wavefroms such as square, sine, triangle, and saw. Have basic effects implemented as well as full attack, sustain, decay, release controls.

### Future Release
Will have a gui and be much more user friendly. Trying to convert to an online platform where I can hosat a website for the synth and drag and drop the recordings being made.
